Performance was favoured over accuracy for some of the functions, and currently only a small set of functions have been implemented.<br/>My aim for this library is to be able to use this in any future games that I develop, so that I have complete control over what all the functions do. It also makes it easier to add new features if the need arises.<br/>Developing this library has been really interesting because of my constant need for making existing functions faster."
